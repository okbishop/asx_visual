ASX quarterly hedge price interactive viewer

This project aims to interactively plot the quarterly ASX hedge price data.

In particular we would like to plot the "forward price curve" of all quarterly products in a similar mannor to that plotted in the daily report, but with an interactive slider used to illustrate the forward price curve as it was at different times.  

We would like to attempt this using d3 and with the crossfilter module.

Joel Miller and Dave Hume are working on this.
